Photography allows you to capture a single moment forever; defying physics and time. Preserving a moment so you can relive it over and over. I want to capture as many of these moments as possible. I want to share these moments, to tell stories with them. 

In my free time I paint, cuddle with my dog and cat, and bake and bake and bake and bake.
